# AJ Wells - Front End Developer

## Introduction

Hello! My name is AJ Wells. As a Front End Developer, I bring over three years of dedicated experience in creating engaging, user-friendly interfaces. My expertise spans React, React Native, TypeScript, and JavaScript, ensuring robust and dynamic web and mobile applications.

## My Journey

I embarked on my development journey in 2004, starting with HTML and CSS before exploring Adobe Flash. After a hiatus in 2008 to broaden my skill set, I returned to development in 2021 by joining a Full Stack Development Bootcamp. This program, running from April to July 2021, significantly enhanced my skills in tools and technologies such as VSCode, JavaScript, jQuery, React, Express, Redux, PostgreSQL, NPM, Node.js, Nodemon, Git, GitHub, and Material UI.

## Professional Experience

Between August 2021 and July 2023, I took on a pivotal role as the Leading Front End Developer for a cattle management company, where I was responsible for building two applications in React and React Native. This experience allowed me to lead UX/UI and graphics development, broadening my expertise in TypeScript, React Native, MongoDB, Realm, XCode, and Android Studio.

## Current Experience

In August 2023, I transitioned from my professional role to focus on personal projects and exploring new opportunities. Currently, I am developing a shopping cart/recipe app in React Native, leveraging Supabase for backend services due to expand my knowledge in backend development. Additionally, I'm venturing into the AI realm, experimenting with Chat GPT to discover innovative application possibilities.

## Looking to the Future

I am deeply committed to continuous learning and growth in the field of Front End Development. My current focus is on absorbing as much knowledge as possible from a variety of resources and influences. Whether it's through personal projects, online courses, or community engagement, I am always seeking opportunities to expand my skill set and adapt to the evolving landscape of technology.

As I look ahead, I am excited about the prospect of embarking on new professional adventures that will challenge me and further my development career. I am particularly interested in projects that leverage cutting-edge technologies and innovative approaches to solve real-world problems. My goal is to contribute to meaningful projects that have a positive impact, while also pushing the boundaries of my own capabilities.

I am open to collaborations, freelance opportunities, and roles that will allow me to bring my unique blend of skills to new teams and projects. If you are looking for a dedicated, creative, and technically skilled Front End Developer, please feel free to reach out to discuss how we can work together on future projects.
